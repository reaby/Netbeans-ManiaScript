Netbeans-ManiaScript
====================

Maniascript language support for netbeans 7.3 and later

Installing
==========

1. Select "Tools|Plugins" from main menu
2. Switch to "Downloaded" tab 
3. Push "Add Plugins..." button
4. Browse to "bin/maniascript.nbm" select it and push Open button
5. Push Install button, then Next > button

Since the plugin is still very alpha, it will warn about cerficate, since I don't have one.

Using
=====

I really tried to make the default ".Script.txt" file handler to work, but after 3 hours i gave up. Rename your maniascript files to ".Script.txtm" and drag'n'drop to netbeans ide.
Currently there will be only text coloring and highliting lexer working, hopefully i get the grammar lexer to work too so we can get nice autocomplete :)
